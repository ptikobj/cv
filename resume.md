Skills

* Enjoy ambitious and challenging projects. Successfully led and
  delivered on a project with a large bank where Blazie was outsourced
  to maintain a legacy code base and produce accessible PDF bank

* Strong business development skills. Responsible for new business

  while at Blazie I piloted a large project for a major client and
  brought on new business through networking at JavaScript meetups in
  London.

  email server where I host my artist portfolio website.

  As an accessibility engineer at Blazie, I was required to find new
  ways of making web and legacy applications accessible without
  relying on clear documentation. Developed JavaScript and COM object
  libraries to overcome accessibility issues between screen readers and
  web/desktop applications.
