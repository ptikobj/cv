# Skills
## Organisational leadership
Successfully led and delivered on an ambitious and challenging new
project with a large bank where Blazie was outsourced to maintain a
legacy code base and produce accessible PDF statements using C# and
iTextSharp.

## Business development
Wholly responsible for marketing and new business development at
Elexsys and increased the company's annual turnover. At Blazie I
led on an ambitious new project for a major banking client and
brought on new business through networking at developer meetups in
London.

## Communication
Comfortable liaising with clients about technical issues and new
business prospects. At Elexsys, I was required to provide technical
demonstrations to university heads of department and engineers. At
Blazie, I provide remote and in-person training and follow-up
support to end users for our software scripts. I'm also required to
attend regular meetings with client developer teams to explain
accessibility concepts and demonstrate WCAG-compliant code fixes.

## Fast learner, eager to upskill
Enjoy learning about new WCAG techniques, JavaScript frameworks,
system administration and Unix environments in my spare time. I run
my own OpenBSD web and email server where I host my artist portfolio
website.

## Creative thinking and problem solving
Able to find unique solutions to tough problems. As an accessibility
engineer at Blazie, I'm required to find new ways of making web
and legacy applications accessible without relying on clear
documentation. Wrote JavaScript and COM object libraries to overcome
accessibility issues between screen readers and web/desktop
applications.

# Interests
## [Painting](https://www.gnchapman.com/)
I trained as an artist at university and keep a painting studio in south
London. I've held a solo exhibition and participated in numerous group
exhibitions in London between 2017 and 2021; participated in a
month-long artist residency in Lisbon in August 2019; and completed the
Turps Off-site mentoring programme in July 2021. In March 2022 I curated
a group show of four emerging painters at no format Gallery in Deptford.

## [Literature & Writing](https://buttondown.email/georgechapman)
I love reading, particularly fiction and art and cultural theory. I
publish a semi-regular newsletter where I write about painting and my
studio practice.

## Music
I play drums for my wife's band
[Pisgah](https://open.spotify.com/artist/1UPaARSJ4GfXKElfW7b2TP).
