# Interests
- interest: Painting
  description: >-
    I trained as an artist at university and keep a painting studio in south
    London. I've held a solo exhibition and participated in numerous group
    exhibitions in London between 2017 and 2021; participated in a
    month-long artist residency in Lisbon in August 2019; and completed the
    Turps Off-site mentoring programme in July 2021. In March 2022 I curated
    a group show of four emerging painters at no format Gallery in Deptford.

- interest: Literature & Writing

    I love reading, particularly fiction and art and cultural theory. I
    publish a semi-regular newsletter where I write about painting and my
    studio practice.
